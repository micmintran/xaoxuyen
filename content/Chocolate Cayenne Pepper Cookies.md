### INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 1 and 1/4 cups all purpose flour be sure to [measure properly](https://freshaprilflours.com/the-importance-of-measuring-ingredients/#spoon-and-level-flour)[](https://freshaprilflours.com/the-importance-of-measuring-ingredients/)
- [ ] 1/4 cup + 2 Tablespoons Rodelle Dutch processed cocoa
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon salt
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper 3/4 teaspoon if you’re feeling **really** spicy!
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- [ ] 1/2 cup unsalted butter at room temperature
- [ ] 1 cup granulated sugar
- [ ] 1 large egg
- [ ] 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- [ ] 4 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chopped

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl with a handheld mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy (approximately 2-3 minutes). Turn the mixer speed down to medium, add the egg and vanilla, and beat again until combined.
3. With the mixer on low, slowly add flour mixture and beat until just combined. Add the chocolate chunks and continue mixing until evenly dispersed. Cover dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 3 days.
4. When you are ready to bake the cookies, line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Set aside. Preheat oven to 350ºF.
5. Using a cookie scoop (I use [this #50 cookie scoop](https://amzn.to/3psmxbH) for all of my standard size cookies), roll the dough into balls and place on prepared baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until edges are set and center is no longer shiny. Remove from oven and allow to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature up to 1 week. Baked cookies can be frozen, up to 2 months. Rolled cookie dough can be frozen, up to 3 months. Place on baking sheet and add 1-2 minutes to baking time.
